# lisp-like-interpreter
Interpreter development in C++ for LISP-like languages:
- LISP-like program contains variable definitions, input/output instructions, conditional and loop statements and is limited to operations involving integer-type variables
- Interpreter operations:
  - Read a file containing the program to be interpreted; the syntax of the program is defined by an unambiguous context-free grammar
  - Execute the program contained in the source file
  - Ask through console for any data input provided by the input instructions and display on the console the result of expressions provided by the output instructions
